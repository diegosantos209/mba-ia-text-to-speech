Three Rings for the Elven kings under the sky,  
Seven for the Dwarves in their rocky halls,  
Nine for Men, doomed to die,  
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne  
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadow lies.  
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,  
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them  
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadow lies.
